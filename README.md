## Developer Python libraries and Astronomy Python libraries

These files are bash scripts to install Python libraries that are helpful in Python app development
and for utilizing Python as an astronomer.

You may want to run "chmod +x" on which ever one you would like to use and make sure you comment "#" out any 
of the python packages you don't need/want installed. 

I really hope this helps some people shave off some time in making all their Python projects run across all their computers.

#Enjoy!!!
